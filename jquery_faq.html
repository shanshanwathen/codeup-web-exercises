<h1 class="text-center">FAQs About National Parks</h1>

<dl>
    <dt>How many national parks are there in total in the United States and Canada?</dt>
    <dd>There are currently 62 National Parks in the United States. However, the National Park System includes  419 national park sites, including memorials, national historic landmarks, heritage areas, etc. Most of the National Parks can be found in the Western United States, such as California, Utah and Colorado. Canada currently has 48 National Parks that are managed by a similar system to the National Park Service.</dd>

    <dt>Which national parks are the most interesting and beautiful to visit?</dt>
    <dd>We think that every national park is worth visiting. However, there are some national parks that are most unique in the world due to their geography. To get the best national park experience we recommend visiting the Grand Canyon, Yosemite, Yellowstone, Rocky Mountain, Zion, and Arches National Parks in the Western United States. Within the Eastern United States, the most famous ones are Acadia, Great Smoky Mountains, and Everglades. Check out our national park routes in different regions to get the best experience.</dd>

    <dt>In which national parks can I observe/see the most wild animals?</dt>
    <dd>All national parks have wildlife from snakes and birds to larger animals, such as wolves, bears, moose and buffalo. To see the most wildlife we always recommend the National Parks that cover large forest areas such as Theodore Roosevelt National Park, Isle Royale, Rocky Mountain or Alaska’s Denali National Park. Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming is often referred to as the Serengeti of America because of its abundance of wildlife.</dd>

    <dt>Are there general rules when visiting a national park or does each park have specific ones?</dt>
    <dd>Yes, there are general rules when visiting national parks and you will find this information under the official website. Also, each national park has specific rules that can change seasonally. For example, the rule of making a campfire may depend on drought conditions and the risk of wildfires.</dd>

    <dt>Where can I get local guide?</dt>
    <dd>Each national park visitor has to sign up at the park's office. This is where you get your local guide, too. In most national parks, the local guides practice a rotation system to ensure every  guide being employed at regular intervals. If you want to see something special and thus need a guide specialized in certain animals, you should get in contact with the park office early in advance. Mostly, a formal written request is needed to book a certain guide with special knowledge.</dd>

    <dt>Can I look animals beyond the normal round trip paths?</dt>
    <dd>No. Only declared persons with scientific research assignments and local guides are allowed to walk or stay outside the marked paths. But every national park has a wide net of different paths and trial for "normal" visitors, and even rare animals can be seen in these areas. So it is usually not necessary to leave the regular trails.</dd>

    <dt>Are night hikes possible?</dt>
    <dd>Unfortunately, night walks are no longer permitted in all official national parks. But there are many alternatives: In all protected areas and reserves, which are run privately, by villages or NGOs, night walks are no problem at all. And it is really incredibly exciting to explore the forests of Madagascar under the starry sky!</dd>

    <dt>What are the rules for the campgrounds in national parks?</dt>
    <dd>Most of the national parks have campgrounds, and the rules apply once inside the national park. When entering a campground, look on the bulletin board to learn about the specific rules in the campgrounds. As a general rule, it is required to keep the campsite clean, and to be quiet after dark. Most of the campgrounds also have a camp host that can answer any specific questions about the rules.</dd>

    <dt>How do I best plan my trip to a national park?</dt>
    <dd>There are two ways to plan a national park vacation. You can choose a special tour operator or you can organize it on your own. Both options have valid advantages. You might get a better price on a hotel through a tour operator, however you might not be as flexible as if you would organize your own vacation.</dd>

    <dt>How did Yellowstone get its name?</dt>
    <dd>Yellowstone National Park is named after the Yellowstone River, the major river running through the park. According to French-Canadian trappers in the 1800s, they asked the name of the river from the Minnetaree tribe, who live in what is now eastern Montana. They responded “Mi tse a-da-zi,” which literally translates as “Rock Yellow River.” The trappers translated this into French as “Roche Jaune” or “Pierre Jaune.” In 1797, explorer-geographer David Thompson used the English translation—“Yellow Stone.” Lewis and Clark called the Yellowstone River by the French and English forms. Subsequent use formalized the name as “Yellowstone.</dd>
